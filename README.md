# Liri
LIRI: It's like SIRI, but for Terminal! Which probably gives it way less market value...

# How it works
Using Node.js and axios, Liri lets you run several commands via your terminal window:<br/>
* concert-this: looks up concerts for a band the user inputs (using Bandsintown)<br/>
* spotify-this-song: looks up a song the user inputs on Spotify (using Spotify's API)<br/>
* movie-this: looks up information for a movie the user inputs (from OMDB)<br/>
* do-what-it-says: performs a command based on an included .txt file<br/>

To perform any of these actions, first download the app with

```
$ git clone 
```
and then open the folder for this app in terminal and type in your command line
```
$ node liri.js
```
followed by the command you want.


*NOTE: This app requires you having Node on your computer to work*
